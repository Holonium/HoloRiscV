# HoloRiscV
A Verilog RISC-V core.

The current version of this code is going to implement the RV32I variant of the RISC-V ISA, with the exception of the `FENCE`, `EBREAK`, and `ECALL` instructions.

At this point, the code in the testing and implementation directories is still incomplete. The current code can be found in the Vivado directory. This is due to the need for hardware simulation. The current plan for memory is an SD card.
